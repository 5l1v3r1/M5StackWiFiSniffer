# M5Stack WiFi Sniffer
WiFi packet sniffer for network analysis 

A M5Stack\M5StickC WiFi promiscuous mode packet sniffer, lazy adaptation of L. Podkalicki packet monitor.

NOTE:
The channels are switched in the loop every 500ms interval, because ESP32's WiFi module doesnâ€™t implement any automated channel switching feature.
